# Unhandled Errors in Express.js Database Interaction

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting proper error handling during database operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database.  However, it lacks crucial error handling for scenarios like invalid user IDs or database connection issues. This can lead to application crashes or inconsistent responses.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, ensuring robustness and reliability.
